                <p>Data Structures</p>
                <p1>The following class is about various data structures such as stacks, queues, lists and trees, and their abstract properties. You can see the implementation of each in the assignments below:</p1>

                    <h4>Assignment 1 - Top Streaming Artists</h4>
                    <p1>In this assignment, I processed a CSV file from Spotify, producing a report with artists and the number of their appearances on the list. This assignment demonstrates the use of LinkedList structure. </p1>

                    <h4>Assignment 2 - Music Playlist</h4>
                    <p1>In this assignment, I also processed a few CSV files from Spotify, producing a playlists with most popular artists. This assignment demonstrates the use of LinkedLists, Queues, and Stacks. </p1>

                    <h4>Assignment 3 - Movie Titles</h4>
                     <p1>In this assignment, I processed a few CSV files from MovieLens, storing the movies in a Binary Search Tree Structure. The program also extracts movie lists for a specified filter. </p1>

                    <h4>Assignment 4 - Movie Genres</h4>
                    <p1>In this assignment, I also processed a few CSV files from MovieLens, and built a filter to sort movies according to their genres. The program produces a report for how many movies came out of each genre for a given period of time. I mainly used ArrayList here. </p1>

                <p>Intro to Modern Programming Techniques</p>
                <p1>This class was about the key concepts in programming emphasizing reliability, maintainability, and reusability, such as multi-file programs, abstract data types, objects, classes, and object-oriented design.</p1>
                <br><br>
                <p3>Over the course of the semester I worked on building a bank account program that allows making deposits, withdrawals, clearing checks, and other basic features of a bank system. Each time I added something to it, and made it more complex, and better. Check out my other website with the code. </p3>
